Variable description

Pruning: Thoroughness of spring pruning; 1 to 5 ordinal scale

Susceptibility to R6-virulent strains: Susceptibility to pathogenic races of P. macularis with virulence Vb,V3,V4,V5,V6 (R6-virulent); 0 to 5 ordinal scale

Susceptibility to non-R6-virulent strains: Susceptibility to pathogenic races of P. macularis with virulence Vb,V3,V5 (non-R6-virulent); 0 to 5 ordinal scale

Area R6: Yearly proportion of hop acreage planted to cultivars susceptible to R6-virulent strains 

Area non-R6: Yearly proportion of hop acreage planted to cultivars susceptible to non-R6-virulent strains 

Mildew may: Incidence of plants with powdery mildew in May; continuous variable

First spray date: Day of year of the first fungicide application

Interval: Mean interval in days between fungicide applications

Initial interval after change: Interval in days of first spray after switching fungicide type

Disease incidence: Seasonal mean incidence of plants with powdery mildew during April to July; continuous variable

Degree centrality: Degree centrality of a yard, with edges weighted by wind run and area of the yard

Annual costs: Annual costs of pesticides for suppression of powdery mildew; expressed in real 2022 dollars per hectare.

Synthetic: Number of nonsynthetic fungicides use per hop yard per year

Nonsynthetic: Number of synthetic fungicides use per hop yard per year

Mixture: Number of applications made using a mixture of at least one synthetic and non-synthetic fungicide per hop yard per year
